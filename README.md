First of all we see the total state forecast which is given as 12000 but if we add the total forecasts for  each zone i.e. (for EAST the sum of forecasts is 2800 , for NORTH it is 1500 , for SOUTH it is 2000 and for WEST it is 6500 ) it comes out to be 12800. 
As it is clearly given that the state forecast is the most accurate hence it is clear that the zonal forecast is inaccurate and we have  to reduce 12800 - 12000 = 800 from the zonal forecast.
Now the redispatch is done in the ratio of forcast by total forecast. So we will calculate the ratio for each zone and then multiply it with 800 to get the actual amount for each zone by which the forecast of each zone is to be reduced.
After doing this now we will go through each farm in each zone and calculate the ratio of forecast/capacity. And after calculating all the ratios for each zone we will normalize it and then calculate the actual power that is to be reduced from each farm in each zone.
